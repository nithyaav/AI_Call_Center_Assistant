Agent: Hello, this is customer support. How can I help you?

Customer: Hi, I'm calling to check the status of my refund. I returned an item three weeks ago.

Agent: Okay, let me check. What's your order number?

Customer: I don't have it with me right now. Can you look it up by my name?

Agent: I need the order number to look it up.

Customer: I told you I don't have it. Can't you search by my email or phone number?

Agent: What's your email?

Customer: It's customer123@email.com.

Agent: Hmm, I'm not finding anything. Are you sure that's the right email?

Customer: Yes, I'm sure! This is ridiculous. How hard is it to find my order?

Agent: Well, without the order number, it's difficult. Can you check your email for the order confirmation?

Customer: I'm not at my computer right now. This is terrible service. I just want to know about my refund!

Agent: I understand, but I really need more information to help you.

Customer: This is a waste of my time. Your system is terrible!

Agent: I'm sorry you feel that way. Maybe you can call back when you have your order number?

Customer: Unbelievable. I'm never shopping with your company again!

Agent: Is there anything else I can help with?

Customer: No! Forget it!

Agent: Okay, have a nice day.

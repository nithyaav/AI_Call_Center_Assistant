Conversation:
Agent: Hello, thank you for calling customer service. This is Mike. How can I assist you?

Caller: Hi, I'm calling about a charge on my credit card that I don't recognize.

Agent: Okay. What's the charge amount and date?

Caller: It's for $89.99 on January 3rd. I didn't make any purchases that day.

Agent: Account number?

Caller: Uh, let me find it... It's 78945612.

Agent: Hold on... Yeah, I see the charge. It's from our online store.

Caller: But I didn't buy anything from your online store. This must be a mistake or fraud.

Agent: Well, it shows as processed. Are you sure no one in your household made the purchase?

Caller: I'm positive. I live alone. Can you tell me what was purchased?

Agent: It says here... wireless headphones.

Caller: I definitely didn't order wireless headphones. I need this charge reversed immediately.

Agent: I can't just reverse charges. There's a process. You'll need to fill out a dispute form.

Caller: A dispute form? This is clearly an error. Can't you just cancel it and refund me?

Agent: Like I said, there's a process. I can email you the form.

Caller: How long will this take? I need that money back in my account.

Agent: Usually takes 5-10 business days to process disputes.

Caller: That's unacceptable! I didn't make this purchase. Why should I wait that long?

Agent: That's just how it works. I don't make the rules.

Caller: Can I speak to a supervisor?

Agent: They'll tell you the same thing. But sure, hold on.

Caller: This is ridiculous. I've been a customer for five years and this is how you treat people?

Agent: I'm just following procedure. Hold please.

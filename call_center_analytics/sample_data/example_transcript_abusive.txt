Agent Maria: Hello, thank you for calling support. This is Maria speaking.

Customer: Yeah, whatever. I need help with my account.

Agent Maria: I'd be happy to help. What's the issue?

Customer: The issue is your stupid system doesn't work! It's completely useless!

Agent Maria: I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you tell me what specifically isn't working?

Customer: Everything! Your whole company is a joke! I can't believe people like you even have jobs!

Agent Maria: I understand you're upset. Let me try to help resolve this.

Customer: You can't help! None of you can! You're all incompetent fools! I've dealt with five different people and they're all equally useless!

Agent Maria: Sir, I really want to help, but I need you to work with me.

Customer: Work with you? Why would I work with someone so stupid? You probably can't even understand what I'm saying!

Agent Maria: That language is inappropriate. I'm here to assist you professionally.

Customer: I don't care about being professional! Your company has wasted hours of my time! Someone needs to pay for this!

Agent Maria: I can offer you compensation for your trouble if you let me help.

Customer: Compensation? I want more than that! You people deserve to be shut down! This is harassment! I'm being treated terribly!

Agent Maria: I assure you we're trying to help. Please let me look into your account.

Customer: Fine, but this better be fixed or I'm filing complaints everywhere! Your whole company is awful!
